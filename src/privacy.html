                    <p>
                        We know you would rather talk to a Bob or a Shirley instead of an automatic phone message. All Johnson customers are assigned a personal service representative who becomes their go-to person during regular business hours.   You don’t call and push buttons to get someone on the phone, you ask for your representative by name.
